    "# 📖 Part 1: Introduction\n",

    "## ❓ What is Parsi.io? ([GitHub](https://github.com/language-ml/parsi.io))\n",
    "\n",
    "`parsi.io` is an **industrial-grade Persian NLP toolkit** maintained by the language-ml lab.\n",
    "It goes beyond basic preprocessing by offering ready-made extractors for prices, quantities, verb morphology, and even Old-Persian text normalization. The project is open-source and receives active updates (≈ 180 commits, last push June 2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ When to Use Parsi.io\n",
    "\n",
    "* **E-commerce or classifieds analytics** – extract prices, units, and product names from unstructured ads.\n",
    "* **Temporal or event extraction** – leverage the verb-information module for tense, person, and root detection.\n",
    "* **Digital-humanities on classical corpora** – Old-Persian normalizer and lemmatizer fill gaps left by Hazm/Parsivar.\n",
    "* **Quick prototyping** – one-line `.run(text)` returns structured JSON, avoiding custom regex pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚫 When Not to Use Parsi.io\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Neural downstream tasks (e.g., text classification, embeddings)** – opt for Hugging Face transformers instead.\n",
    "* **Token-level customization** – if you need low-level control over tokenization or custom linguistic attributes, spaCy with a Persian model is more flexible.\n",
    "* **Ultra-large corpora requiring distributed processing** – parsi.io is a pure-Python library aimed at single-machine workloads; Spark-based pipelines or Elastic Search ingest plugins may scale better."
